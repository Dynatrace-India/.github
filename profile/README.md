### Our Story
This started all the way back in 2016 where Dynatrace was coming to India and adoption was started because of its magical AI. With the help of the Indian sales team and with some partners we were able to pull some great talents in the industry and work on building the team of services experts who deploy and configure Dynatrace in customer locations. We faced many challenges along the way and it was never easy. Every obstacle seemed to be crossable with the skill and experience we had in the APM industry. We did it!! 
Currently, we are 40+ members present in the team with more than 10+ persistent projects all the time. 90% of the members are certified with Dynatrace Associate Certification and Over 30% of them are Professionally Certified.
